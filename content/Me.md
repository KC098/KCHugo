# Hi!
My name's Cesar, I'm a game developer working in the industry since 2021 making VR games and simulators.
My main tools for developing games are Unity, Blender, Visual Studio and Krita.


When it comes to roles, I'd say I'm more of a generalist.
Programming & Modeling are the areas that I work the most, I also have experience in Shaders, Animation, VFX, UI, Project Management and Networking.

I enjoy the artistics aspects of creating a game (programming is an art too!) and how everything comes together to create an experience that's going to affect the people's mood, way of thinking and/or lives!
That's why I always strive to offer the best that I can even if it's outside of my expertise.

# Hobbies
## Games
I play both single and multplayer games.
I create smaller games using Godot and have been testing out Roblox Studio.
## Art
If im not making games I like to make 3D models of characters.
I like to draw digitally and traditionally.
## Exercise
I like to walk outside with my dog (It's a Chihuahua).
I have been getting into calithsenics recently.
